# Smart Door Lock System using Arduino Nano

This project is a keypad-based smart door lock system built using an Arduino Nano, designed as part of our IoT curriculum.

## Project Highlights:
- **Arduino Nano**
- **4x4 Keypad** for secure PIN entry
- **Servo Motor** to control the locking mechanism
- **SSD1306 OLED Display** for user interaction
- **LED indicators & Buzzer** for real-time feedback

## How It Works:
1. Users enter a 4-digit PIN.
2. On correct input (`#`), the system displays "Welcome To Home", activates the servo to unlock, and blinks a green LED.
3. On wrong input, it shows "Wrong Password", flashes a red LED, and sounds a buzzer alert.
4. The OLED displays messages and guides the user through the process.
